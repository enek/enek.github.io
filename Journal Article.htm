Used around the world as an art form, furniture covering and decoration, papier-mâché is a hands-on, individualized way to cover a surface.</p><p>Tony Caveney of Generations Decorating has taken this ancient art to a whole new level, using it to cover floors. His artistic leanings come from long-ago sowed seeds, too. As a third-generation wallpaper installer, he merges his technical abilities with his own artistic bent toward this ancient art.</p><p>"I first saw this technique on walls. But it was very expensive. I wanted to break into a more affordable market, and I knew I had to beat the high price point I'd seen. Making it myself is the only way to do that," he explains as he shows me a stack of uncoated samples that he's hand-painted in his workshop.</p><p>"It's cost effective at around $3 a foot for the paper, which comes on big rolls, plus the installation and coating. And it's a great do-it-yourself product, so long as you use the proper coating."</p><p>Though he has been a wall-paper installer for years, Caveney created this method for floors, making a durable surface that shows off the intricacies of the paper.</p><p>The paper is used just as it was thousands of years ago; pieces are ripped from the hand-painted sheets that Caveney has prepared. The irregularly ripped shapes are then glued onto the floor. Once dry, an industrial two-component urethane clear coat is applied over the floor, making it hard and shiny. One notable thing about the installation is that, as long as the underneath surface is sealed, the paper can go down over almost anything. Cracks and damage are easily hidden, and previously multi-covered surfaces (for example, plywood subfloor and old linoleum) can be blended seamlessly.</p><p>Such is the case at Walls Alive, a decorating store in Edmonton's west end. The store previously had an expensive commercial floor, but it had been badly damaged. They used Caveney's papier-mâché technique to recover the entire surface, repairing cracks and heaves and then papering right over them. Then the durable, shiny coating was applied.</p><p>"The floor makes the store look elegant, and it's tough," says Dwayne Huzar, coating specialist at Walls Alive. "It's easy to clean - we have con-tractors and customers coming through all day, but we haven't had many scratches. All manner of stuff has been dragged across that floor. It sure beats hardwood or tile," he says.</p><p>"Interior installations are foolproof," says Caveney. "It goes right over top of existing flooring because it is so thin. This saves on labour, too," he attests.</p><p>The floors can be customized to almost any colour. Once colour and style have been chosen, Caveney uses different techniques such as crinkling and dragging to stylize the paper. The turnaround time for installation can be as fast as six hours.</p><p>Caveney notes that repairs are also a reason he loves this technique.</p><p>If something is dropped on the surface it is simply filled and the paper and urethane layered over top to cover the damage.</p><p>Unlike repairing hardwood scratches - with a patch job or new boards, sanding, and stain - or replacing tile using glue, sealant and new tile, the process is a quick fix.</p><p>"The beauty of the paper is that it's portable, so if you damage something it's easily replaced."</p><p>The paper-layering technique is multi-faceted and durable enough to withstand exterior applications.</p><p>Caveney recommends the flooring for decks, tables, gar-ages, basements, countertops, and retail and commercial spaces.</p><p>He also notes that the installation process is low VOC (volatile organic compound).</p><p>"Chinese papier-mâché has been done for thousands of years, so I'm not original - but I haven't seen anything else quite like this."</p><p>fast facts</p><p>Tony Caveney's product can be purchased through his company website or at Walls Alive.</p><p>Generations Decorating: Tony Caveney, 780-267-3289.
